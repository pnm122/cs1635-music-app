These are just notes to myself for future reference to explain why I made the design choices I did. Feel free to read them tho :)

### Change to make post lists reusable

In its previous implementation, a PostView took in a boolean to say whether the list was the user's following feed or all popular posts, making it unusable anywhere else in code. I needed it to be used on profile pages to display all of the users' posts and on song pages, to display all of the covers of a song. The clear way to do this was to pass in a List of Post into the PostViewModel, so that PostViews could be used anywhere with any Posts. I then wrapped the homepage in a viewmodel so that we could get the popular and following posts that we will pass into the PostViews. The problem then was that the following post list wouldn't update, because followingPosts was just a static list in the HomepageViewModel. I wanted to call a function inside of HomepageViewModel to refresh followingPosts, but not all PostViews will have a HomepageViewModel above it to reference. To solve this, I pass in an optional parameter into PostViews where you can declare if the PostView is part of the homepage. If so, when you follow/unfollow a user, it also calls the updateFollowingPosts function in HomepageViewModel. The current behavior is that when a user is unfollowed on the following tab, the posts don't get removed immediately from the following tab, but only when you leave that tab and come back to it. This is the behavior I want, because it means the following page won't jump the instant you unfollow someone. However, I'm not actually sure why this is the case rather than just being immediately removed.
